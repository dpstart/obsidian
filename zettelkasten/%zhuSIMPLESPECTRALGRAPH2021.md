Simple Spectral Graph Convolution

Graph convolution method to avoid oversmoothing. Here, the authors propose a pectral-based graph convolution layer, called Simple Spectral Graph Convolution (S2GC), which is based on the Markov Diffusion Kernel (MDK). The authors show that S2GC is capable of aggregating k-hop neighbourhood information without oversmoothing.
