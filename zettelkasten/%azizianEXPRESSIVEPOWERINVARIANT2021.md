This theoretical paper compares the expressive power of three types of invariant and equivariant GNNs against the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) tests, proves function approximation results for these GNNs, and demonstrates that 2-FGNN\_E works well for the quadratic assignment problem.  One of the main results is showing that k-FGNN are as powerful as the (k-)
