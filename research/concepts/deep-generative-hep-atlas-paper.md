## What

Use of [[deep-generative-models]]  ([[GAN]]s + [[VAE]]s) from simulationg showers in the  [[atlas]] detector. Goal: [[fast-calorimeter-simulation]].

The paper is the first applications of this models to fast simulation of the calorimeter response. The study focuses on showers for photons over a range of energies in the central region of the calorimeter.

## Why

Full simulation is slow and presents a bottleneck in the simuation pipeline. [[fast-calorimeter-simulation]] now relies on techniques based on thousands of indvidual parametrizations of the calorimeter response in the longitudinal and transverse direction given  a single particle's energy and pseudorapidity.
