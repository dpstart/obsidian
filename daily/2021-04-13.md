Energy and focus are the two most important assets I have in my life.

Most things I do should either increase it, or at least avoid dispersing it. 

Things that ruin both energy levels and focus are: **masturbation**, mindlessly surfing the internet, watching random youtube videos, using social media throghout the day, bad sleep schedule, multitasking.
Things that increase it are: good sleep schedule, productivity (which definitely compounds), healthy eating habits, physical activity, being outside, the sun, making progress on stuff, meditation.

The feeling of continuous, wasted potentials is the only thing that can actively ruin in my life that is my complete control. I have full responsibility for it. It depends on no one but me. That is why it is so frustraining. And, as almost everything else, it boils down to the systems that I've put in place to conduct my life. It's bad feedback loops mostly.

Anxiety and unrest make me watch porn and procrastrinate. Procrastrinating makes procrastrinating easier the next time I do it. bad, fucking feedback loops.
