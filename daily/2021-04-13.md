Energy and focus are the two most important assets I have in my life. Most things I do should either increase it, or avoid dispersing it. 

Things that ruin both energy levels and focus are: masturbation, mindlessly surfing the internet, watching random youtube videos, using social media, bad sleep schedule.
Things that increase it are: good sleep schedule, productivity (which definitely compounds), healthy eating habits, physical activity.
