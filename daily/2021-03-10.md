Back to day 1 of NoFap. I am going to track my state of mind and body in these notes.

**Day 1** : 

* slept more than 8 hours. Woke up reasonably rested. Feel less brain fog than yesterday. Still no cravings.
* Feel a bit lost phd-wise. Not sure what to work on, not sure what to focus on. I want to publish. I need validation that I can do this shit.
* I need to make my learning more disciplined. Go deep instead of wide. Get back to the stuff you learn to check recollection and understanding.
