* SOTA was suspicious indeed. Leakage between train and val sets. Fuck.
* Reading the PhD grind makes me feel less alone.
* I fucking need research ideas. I don't feel confident enough in the field. 
* I have written to Simone Scardapane, let's see if we can collaborate. I need to do more cold emailing to research, apparently everyone answers.
* graph task: use discrete representations for nodes??? as in vq-vae?? but why?
* code flow is the best
* Flow was good. Written a lot of decent code very fast. Got preliminary result on vector quantizing the node representation for graph classification. At least it does not degrade performance, which should be good?
