* Defining what to work on the night before really helps with clarity and motivation. It's difficult to choose in the morning, close in time to when I actually need to do the work.

* Reading the [[principles of effective research]] from [[michael nielsen]] really helped. Ton of motivation, much more clarity and confidence.

* Starting out today with some code. I want to run the [[~graph transformers]] without any batches to see whether the failure is due to batching or it comes from deeper. Then I'll make some slides on the graph transformer architectures.

* Spent the morning fixing some very frustrating bug on the pytorch code for full batch graph transformers. The results on Cora are better that with minibatching, but still not competitive with GAT and also need more parameters. No bueno. I have doubts that this transformer stuff can work well on graphs. One of the issues is also the fact that it's hard to go deep in graphnets due to oversmoothing and stuff. 

* Starting to write some slides for the group and also to clear my mind about this stuff.
