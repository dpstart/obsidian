* Defining what to work on the night before really helps with clarity and motivation. It's difficult to choose in the morning, close in time to when I actually need to do the work.

* Reading the [[principles of effective research]] from [[michael nielsen]] really helped. Ton of motivation, much more clarity and confidence.

* Starting out today with some code. I want to run the [[~graph transformers]] without any batches to see whether the failure is due to batching or it comes from deeper. Then I'll make some slides on the graph transformer architectures.
