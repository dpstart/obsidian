* Feeling sluggish and unfocuses. Important to get back on track by doing things. Not good that I have to make presentations almost every week which take away time and mental energy.
* I overstate my failures. I have worked for not even a week on the code for the graphormer, which is complicated stuff, and whose original paper was worked on my many authors. It's only normal that it takes me time. I should just continue and not feel demotivated for nothing. Failure is everything. But this model is a bitch.

* Things to do: log learning rate, understand the schedule.
