* It's been unfocused and unproductive for the last couple of weeks. Not having a clear task to work on is really the stuff that kills your productivity and motivation. And getting back on track is difficult, especially when you are still missing a clear goal, something to work on for which you have a pinch of certainty that it would make an interesting contribution.
* The current state of the situation is:
	* The HEP stuff goed very very slow, and the generative task is not very well defined, as far as performance metrics and purpose are concerned. Altough I am starting to think that maybe we should just start working in it and see what happens. But the physics people are increadibly slow at starting projects.
	* The solar stuff is going even slower. I am having issues even getting response from the other researchers, so at the moment there is pretty much nothing going on there except for some initial ideas.
	* The pure ML stuff is a bit more interesting, but of course still full of stepbacks and failures. The graph transformer part hit a dead end. I have no more trust in the idea, so I have just dropped it, which I think makes sense. For the quantization stuff, I am note sure. For the generative part, I am actually excited about that. I think it could work, and it's interesting that I now have an open line with Simo
