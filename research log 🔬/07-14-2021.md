* It's been way too long since my last research log. I need to write more. And remember that I forget stuff if I don't, and end up being massively inefficient.
* I want to be an astronaut. So let's focus on science.

* Things I should study hard: [[mixture of gaussians]], [[mixture of bernoulli]]. They look incredibly important for ml research. For example, the [[mixture of bernoulli]] was used for capturing correlations among edges in the [[GRAN]] model.

* I need to run [[GRAN]] on the graphs I am generating from the [[calohits]] point clouds. I am procrastinating too much on this.
