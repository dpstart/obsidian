ADAPTIVE UNIVERSAL GENERALIZED PAGERANK GRAPH NEURAL NETWORK


The goal is to build a model that can adapt to both homophily and heterophily settings, and combat oversmoothing. The proposed approach incorporated the generalized page rank (GPR) algorithm in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs).

Simply put, the GPR algorithm assigns scores to nodes in a graph that are then used for clustering purposes.
